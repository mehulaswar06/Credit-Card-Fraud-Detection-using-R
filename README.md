"# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-using-R" 
Credit Card Fraud Detection model using R and Different Machine learning algorithms.

Abstract:
--------
Fraud is one of the major ethical issues in the credit card industry in recent
years.
Credit card frauds are easy targets. E-commerce and many other online sites have
increased online payment modes, thereby increasing the risk of online frauds. Due
to an increase in fraud rates, researchers started using different machine learning
methods to detect and analyze frauds in online transactions.
The main aim of this project is to analyze the past transaction details of the
customers and extract the patterns and try to build different fraud detection
models by using algorithms like Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression,
etc. by training those with available data and testing the model efficiency with test
data and deploying the model which is giving more accuracy to predict any fraud
transaction in real-time easily, making transactions more secure.

Data in credit card.csv was in very unbalanced format so i used smote method to balance the data and then used Decision Tree algorithm to build model.
